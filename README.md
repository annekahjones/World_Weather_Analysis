# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6

The goal of this project is to use API calls to gather weather data for randomly generated locations and create a DataFrame using this information. Next, we gathered user input for weather preferences in order to provide potential travel destinations and hotels and provide these options on a map. Lastly, we used a routing API to create a travel itinerary to show the route between four cities chosen from the possible travel destinations and created a map with pop-up markers for each city.
